<h1> A Few of Khadeeja's Hobbies </h1>
<h2> 3 of my hobbies that I'll never stop  </h2>
<h3> <hr/> </h3>
<h3> 1) Reading </h3>
<p> I love reading. <br/>
I love reading of almost all kinds of genres, but most of all, I love reading thriller stories. They could be Novels, Comics or even short stories. Though I sometimes get nightmares because of the things I read, I still can't get myself to stop...<br/> Other genres I like are action, drama, mystery.<br/>
A few webtoon comics I'd recommend you to read if you're into thriller are: <br/> 1. Like Mother, Like Daughter <br/> 2. Everything is fine <br/> 4. Memorial </p>

<p> I enjoy reading Islamic literature as well, I've finished reading The sealed nectar, Sahih Bukhari and a few other books as well, but currently i'm trying to complete my reading of Tafseer Ibn Kaseer. <br/>
<br/> I know how to read English, Urdu, Hindi, Kannada and Arabic, but the only literature i'm willing to read because i understand the language thoroughly and fluently is English. I'm not fluent in reading urdu and the understanding of the other languages are beyond my strengths, hence, I am only comfortable reading the English Language.</p>

<h3> 2) Writing </h3>
<p> I really enjoy writing, its my way of expressing feelings, thought, emotions and creativity.<br/>
On  a regular basis I just write diary entries in a journal. i've written a bunch of stories, poems and one-liners. I started writing stories since I was 10, and i also have an ongoing story which i started writing abt 4 years ago but it hasn't really ended, and i'm like....on a break from all that writing right now due to severity of my studies.<br/> <br/1>  The names of a few of the poems I've written are, "Smile", "Maths", and "Guess".</p>
<h3> 3) Photography </h3>
<p> I photograph everything I like. I see the sunset, Click!<br/> I see a beautiful Flower, Click!<br/> I see a plate of delicious food, Click!<br/> An old monument, Click!<br/> The nicght sky, Click!<br/> The sunrise, Click!<br/> Green plants, Click!<br/> Grass, Click!<br/> A buliding with great infrastructure, Click! <br/> The list is never ending, The only things out of frame are humans and Animals. <br/><br/> Honestly, To me, These photographs mean so much more than just what meets the eye. It's the situations, environments, emotions and feelings surrounding the moment of the click that go into the photo that makes it special. <br/> For example, among all the photos I've taken, My favourite one is the one i call, "Roadside Baloon Vine", to anyone who sees the photo, its just another picture of a baloon vine, but to me, its the once in a lifetime view of that particular baloon vine I coincidentally noticed while I was on a walk towards my deantist's, I was with my mom and randomly spotted this vine among the roadside weeds and i just felt like taking a click. There's no exact explanation to why this picture has taken its place among my favourites when i've taken many other photos more excellent than these, but this one's my favourite anyways.  </p>
